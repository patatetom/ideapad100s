## prerequisites

- a fairly recent and functional GNU/Linux system
- a USB flash drive with a capacity of at least 2Gb
- the [latest release](https://github.com/SwagArch/swagarch-build/releases/latest) of SwagArch



## before installation

the Ideapad is delivered with 32-bit UEFI firmware and SwagArch, like many other GNU/Linux distributions, is not « mixed mode » : so it must therefore be slightly modified in order to boot.
